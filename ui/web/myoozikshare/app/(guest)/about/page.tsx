      Score reading is not a skill possesed by many people. A significant number of people desire
      to know how to correctly sing a song but they can't since they don't know how to interpret a
      score and they do not have someone readily available to help them do so. That is the problem
      that MyoozikShare helps to solve. We bring together musicians with knowledge and skills
      necessary for score interpretation and those who don't. We believe that every music enthusiast
      deserves a supportive community that help complement each other.
